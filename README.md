# Malware-Detection-System
This project aims to create a simple malware scanner utilizing hybrid code that combines both the hash-based and rule-based malware scanning approaches. The hybrid code uses the hash-based scanning to detect known malware with high confidence, and the rule-based scanning to detect new or unknown malware.
